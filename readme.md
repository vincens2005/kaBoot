that's it.

leave the game url blank for the default game.

otherwise see `src/test_game.json` for an example game.

A good way to host your game is through GitHub gists, because they have no CORS policy. Just make a new gist, type you JSON in there, and then use the `raw` button to get the raw url, which you can paste into kaüÖ±Ô∏èoot.
